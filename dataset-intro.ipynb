    "The key reason for asking this question is that parasites which are transmitted by mosquito (**MT**) are less virulent (severe/harmful) than those which are serially blood passaged (**SBP**) in the laboratory. _Figure 1A_ shows the malaria life cycle, the red part highlighting the mosquito stage. _Figure 1B_ shows the difference in virulence, measured by blood parasitemia (presence of parasites in the blood), between mosquito-transmitted and serially blood passaged parasites.  \n",
    "\n",
    "_Figure 1C_ shows that increasing numbers of blood passage post mosquito transmission results in increasing virulence, back to around 20% parasitemia.  Subsequent mosquito transmission of high virulence parasites render them low virulence again. \n",
    "\n",
    "We hypothesise that parasites which have been through the mosquito are somehow better able to control the mosquito immune system than those which have not. This control of the immune system would result in lower parasitemia because this is advantageous for the parasite. Too high a parasitemia is bad for the mouse and therefore bad for the parasite."

Experiments in the lab often exclude the mosquito stage (red) and instead remove parasites from the blood of a mouse to infect another mouse (serial blood passage). (B) Serially blood passaged parasites (red) are more virulent than mosquito-transmitted parasites (blue) as shown by their higher parasitemia over the course of an infection. (C) As mosquito transmitted parasites are serially passaged an increasing number of times, they return to a higher level of parasitemia._"
