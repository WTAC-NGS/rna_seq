    "[Integrative Genome Viewer](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/) (**IGV**) allows us to visualise genomic datasets. We have a quick start guide [here](../IGV/index.ipynb) which contains the information you need to complete [Exercise 3](#Exercise-3). The full IGV user guide can be found [here](http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/UserGuide) and contains information on all of the IGV features and functions.\n",

    "  * _load an annotation file into IGV and explore gene structure_\n",
