    "The main objective of this part of the tutorial is to use simple Unix commands to get a list of significantly differentially expressed genes. Using this gene list and the quantitative information from our analysis we can then start to make biological inferences about our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the R script (`sleuth.R`), we printed out a file of results describing the differentially expressed genes in our dataset. This file is called **`kallisto.results`**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The file contains several columns, of which the most important are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Column 1**: target_id (gene id)  \n",
    "  * **Column 2**: description (some more useful description of the gene than its id)  \n",
    "  * **Column 3**: pval (p value)    \n",
    "  * **Column 4**: qval (p value corrected for multiple hypothesis testing)  \n",
    "  * **Column 5**: b (fold change)  \n",
    "\n",
    "With a little Linux magic we can get the list of differentially expressed genes with only the columns of interest as above."
